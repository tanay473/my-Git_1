# Community Platform Project - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Community Platform project, including the fixes implemented for file updating, team management, and AI Assistant integration.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular Flask application structure:

- `app.py`: Main application entry point
- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `models/`: Data models and database interaction
  - `routes/`: API endpoints and route handlers
  - `static/`: Static assets (JS, CSS)
  - `templates/`: HTML templates
- `deploy.sh`: Deployment script
- `run.sh`: Local development script
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `test_functionality.py`: Test suite for validating functionality

## Implemented Fixes

### Team Management

The team management functionality has been enhanced with the addition of a robust member removal feature. This implementation includes:

1. Database layer support for removing members from workspaces
2. API endpoint for member removal with proper permission checks
3. Atomic updates to both workspace and user records to maintain data consistency

The member removal functionality ensures that workspace owners can effectively manage their team composition while maintaining proper access controls. Only workspace owners can remove members, and the system prevents removing the workspace owner to maintain workspace integrity.

### File Updating and Versioning

The file updating and versioning system has been validated and enhanced with:

1. Improved file content storage with deduplication
2. Robust file listing functionality to view all files in a workspace
3. Enhanced version retrieval with proper error handling
4. Comprehensive version history tracking

The file versioning system now provides a complete Git-like experience, allowing users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and maintain a comprehensive history of all file modifications within their workspaces.

### AI Assistant Integration

The AI Assistant feature has been significantly improved with:

1. Robust Gemini API integration with proper error handling
2. Retry logic for API resilience
3. Improved response formatting for better user experience
4. Status endpoint for API diagnostics
5. Enhanced development mode with realistic simulated responses

The AI Assistant now provides reliable, helpful responses for both editors and music directors, with context-aware suggestions tailored to their specific roles and project needs.

## Deployment Instructions

### Local Development

To run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the application: `./run.sh`
3. Access the application at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Production Deployment

To deploy the application to production:

1. Upload the project files to your server
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set environment variables:
   - `FLASK_APP=app.py`
   - `FLASK_ENV=production`
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key` (for AI Assistant functionality)
4. Run the deployment script: `./deploy.sh`

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is included to validate all functionality:

1. Team management tests (add/remove member)
2. File versioning tests (create/get/list/revert)
3. AI Assistant tests (editor/music director assistance)

Run the tests with: `python test_functionality.py`

## Conclusion

The Community Platform now provides a robust, feature-complete environment for collaborative content creation. The implemented fixes ensure reliable team management, comprehensive file versioning, and intelligent AI assistance for all team members.
